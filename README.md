## Getting started

> Install yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

First run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Then use `yarn start` to start the development server. It will be running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

To run the server, use `yarn serve`.

To do both, use `yarn dev`.

To create a build, run `yarn build`.
